#Agl Test Suites

The repository is used to store test scripts,
and the source code of test sets that are not maintained upstream.

##Building

Before compiling image, add "agl-test" to the source option to
compile the agl-test into the image.
After that, load the compiled image onto the board.

##Running

Run the following command to execute all the test set:
agl-test

##Directory Structure

Take "rpm" as an example to illustrate the file contents
contained in each OSS directory:

rpm
├── rootfs-scripts
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── parser.py
│   ├── report.py
│   ├── run_tests.py
│   └── resource
│       ├── rpm_test.sh
│       ├── test-manual-1.2.3.noarch.rpm
│       └── tests
│           ├── rpm_01.sh
│           ├── rpm_02.sh
│           └── rpm_03.sh
│
└── yocto-scripts

###rootfs-scripts:

####__init__.py, parser.py, report.py and run_tests.py:

The files of __init__.py, parser.py, report.py and run_tests.py,
these are the scripts required by the testing framework

####criteria.json:

criteria.json is a threshold file reserved for benchmark testing,
which can be omitted in functional testing

####resource:

The resource directory stores the source code of the test set
without upstream maintenance.
The actual execution is performed by run_tests.py
calls the script under resource

###yocto-scripts:
Under "yocto-scripts" is the script for compiling the test set. If the
test set does not need to be compiled, this script can be omitted.
Since rpm does not need to be compiled, this directory is omitted
